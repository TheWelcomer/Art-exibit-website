        <b>"Just a Tune" A Haudenosaunee Seed Song (Iroquois)</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        While many children are taught today that the US was groundbreaking in its republican ideals, it wasn't the first large-scale nation in North America to use this system of government. The Iroquois Confederacy was a group of tribes around the Great Lakes region which shared a diverse culture and robust representative system of government. This song of the Iroquois was sung to give gratitude to the land and seeds as they planted both community gardens and farmland. The song represents the Iroquois peoples' deep respect for their environment and all that it provided them. With the westward expansion of the US, the Iroquois Confederacy ceded most of its homeland and, though it still exists today, is mostly confined to reservations in upstate New York. The fall of the Iroquois shows how the industrialist ideals of the United States not only destroyed the beauty of many natural environments, but destroyed a culture with deep respect for nature and all it provided.
