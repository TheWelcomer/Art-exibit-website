        <b>Cassils, Inextinguishable Fire, 2007-2015</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Inextinguishable fire at first glance can simply be viewed as a performance of insanity, a person setting themselves on fire just because it's such an extreme act. It's so extreme that it could be interpreted in many ways or not interpreted at all, but I believe a simple and common interpretation is that people are willing to potentially destroy themselves for their own amusement. It reminds me of a practice called Fire-stick farming which was practiced by Aboriginal Australians who burned down forests and grasslands to flush out animals from cover. In the long-term, historians believe this helped scorch most of Australia and create the Outback.
