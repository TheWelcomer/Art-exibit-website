        <b>Kari Kari Group, Sau Sau Easter Island Dance, 2014</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        This dance of the Rapa Nui, the indigenous peoples of Easter Island, is called the Sau Sau and is one of their most popular types of dances. The movement of the dancers' arms and hips represent the smooth flow of water found around Easter Island and their traditional dresses are made from feathers and grasses. The dance is very representative of the Rapa Nui's island environment and shows their close ties to the land. Unfortunately, its believed that during the height of the Rapa Nui civilization, the natural resources of the island were overexploited to an unsustainable degree, with a large amount of resources going to building the moai, known widely as the "Easter Island heads". Its believed that during the environmental collapse following Easter Island's overexploitation, their population dropped by around 80%. If our unsustainable exploitation of nature continues, we could very well face a similar collapse.
