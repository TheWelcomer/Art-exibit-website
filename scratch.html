        <b>Donald Winkelman, Forest Clicker, 2023</b>
        <br>

        This interactive artwork, personally created by the curator, takes the theme of humanity's war with nature a step further by transforming the viewer into an activist fighting to save a small forest from destruction. I (the curator) believe that attendees of this exhibit should not only walk away understanding our war with nature, but with an understanding of what we can do to stop it. In this game, your goal is to raise enough Awareness to make the forest a nature reservation and you'll lose if Lord Business (your adversary) is able to chop down all the trees before you can preserve the forest. Awareness is raised both by clicking the campaign button and raising awareness passively from conservancy groups, which you can create by spending Awareness. For more information about the game, please choose the tutorial option by typing "yes" and pressing enter at the beginning of the game. The game can be played by clicking the green flag. If you are having trouble running or playing the game, please don't hesitate to contact me at <a href="dwinkelman@umass.edu">dwinkelman@umass.edu</a>. Can you save the forest in time? Good luck!
