    <!--The personal artwork piece will be something similar to an interactive pudding.cool page. Current themes and their cooresponding personal piece ideas:
    Theme: Presenting the idea of deforestation as an actual war on nature, idk. First artwork could be an American conservation painting from the 1800's, the next could be something modern like the deforestization of Brazil or the firestick farming practices of Australia. 
    The third photo could be a more modern tycoon or anti-tycoon type game where you have to fight deforestization. Then, the fourth could represent the benefits of preserving nature in our modern day.
