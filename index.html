    <!--The personal artwork piece will be something similar to an interactive pudding.cool page. Current themes and their cooresponding personal piece ideas:
    Theme: Presenting the idea of deforestation as an actual war on nature, idk. First artwork could be an American conservation painting from the 1800's, the next could be something modern like the deforestization of Brazil or the firestick farming practices of Australia. 
    The third photo could be a more modern tycoon or anti-tycoon type game where you have to fight deforestization. Then, the fourth could represent the benefits of preserving nature in our modern day.-->

                Welcome to the final project performance! With generous grants from UMass and donations from groundbreaking artists from across the world, we've curated a collection of 5 artworks representing man's war with nature, and the few brave souls who seek to preserve its beauty.
                <br>
                <br>
                This website serves as a catalog for these 5 brilliant pieces, teaching their history and greater meaning in regards to humanity's war on nature. I chose this theme because the vast majority of people are not on the supposed "front lines" of this conflict. They don't see the damage we are causing, and therefore feel little need to preserve nature. There have been some efforts to preserve nature, like the creation of the National Park Service in the US or many European cities incorporating greenery into their cities, but these efforts in the grand scheme of things are few and far between. The purpose of this exhibit is to transport the content, first-world citizens who view it to the front lines of our war against nature to show them the destruction we are causing to our environment.

                This art exhibit will take place in my home city of Austin, which has actually done a relatively good job at preserving greenery in and around its downtown area. The <a href="https://zilkergarden.org/">Zilker Botanical Garden</a> sets an example for how cities can preserve greenery in their downtown areas. This publicly funded park focuses on growing plants native to Austin and hosts conservancy groups and events. More specifically, the exhibit will be hosted outdoors with accomodations such as tents and water-cooled fans in place to shelter the exhibit and keep our guests cool in the Austin heat. Attendees will be encouraged to visit the interactive art piece last, but will have the freedom to explore the pieces in this exhibit in any order they like.
